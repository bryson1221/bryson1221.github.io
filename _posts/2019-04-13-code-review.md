#### ePortfolio Selection and Refinement Plan

## Software Design/Engineering

Category One: Software Engineering/Design - Tic-tac-toe application I created while in class CS-319. 

This project is written in C# using Visual Studio 2022 as my IDE. 

Currently, the app looks decent, but I would like to tweak the appearance and possibly resize the application. 

Current issues that need to be fixed are - restarting the game after someone wins or results in a tie. 

When you select File -> new game, the application does not start a new game. Instead, you must exit the application and re-open it. 

I have an option in the app to allow Player One and Player Two to enter their names, but I am experiencing issues with the Game settings I created. 

I would like Player One or Player Two to be able to choose ‘x’ or ‘o’ and which player goes first. 


## Algorithms and Data Structures

Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures - Quiz Game

I will expand the complexity of a quiz game I created when I first began classes at SNHU. 

I would like to add levels of difficulty, some type of scoring system, sound effects, graphics, a timer, a leaderboard, and categories to select from. 

Adding difficulty levels such as easy, medium, and hard allow the user to choose the level they want to play. 

A scoring system will incentive the user to earn points for correct answers and lose points for wrong answers. 

Sound effects and graphics will make it more interactive and engaging. A timer will give the user a certain amount of time to answer each question. 

A leaderboard will store the user’s scores and rank them (maybe a top 10).  

Categories will give the user options and allow them to choose which category they will be quizzed on. 

## Databases

Category Three: Databases

I can perform CRUD operations within my SQLite Database. I can create a ‘made-up golfer’ and fill in his stats to compare with the professionals.

I will read into stats that may or may not be relevant to the outcome of a golfer’s success.

I can update the database with additional stats, such as average driving distance and accuracy percentage.

I can delete data that is less relevant to determining a golfer’s success.  

Additionally, I want to clean up my database and remove a lot of ‘noise’ that makes it unreadable & add a security feature.
