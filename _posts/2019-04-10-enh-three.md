## Enhancement Three: Data Bases

Category Three: Databases, 

I can perform CRUD operations within my SQLite Database. I can create a ‘made-up golfer’ and fill in his stats to compare with the professionals.

I will read into stats that may or may not be relevant to the outcome of a golfer’s success.

I can update the database with additional stats, such as average driving distance and accuracy percentage.

I can delete data that is less relevant to determining a golfer’s success.  

Additionally, I want to clean up my database and remove a lot of ‘noise’ that makes it unreadable & add a security feature.

## Update

TBA
