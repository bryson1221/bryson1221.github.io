## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

Category One: Software Engineering/Design - Tic-tac-toe application I created while in class CS-319. 

This project is written in C# using Visual Studio 2022 as my IDE. 

Currently, the app looks decent, but I would like to tweak the appearance and possibly resize the application. 

Current issues that need to be fixed are - restarting the game after someone wins or results in a tie. 

When you select File -> new game, the application does not start a new game. Instead, you must exit the application and re-open it. 

I have an option in the app to allow Player One and Player Two to enter their names, but I am experiencing issues with the Game settings I created. 

I would like Player One or Player Two to be able to choose ‘x’ or ‘o’ and which player goes first. 

## Update

Artifact One is a Tic-Tac-Toe application I created while in class CS-319. 

I selected this item to showcase my abilities to improve efficiency via Software Engineering/Design. 

The specific components of this artifact I have improved are:

•	a functIoning ‘New Game’ selection from the file menu rather than closing the app and restarting each time you want to start a new game. 
    
    o   I found a more efficient way to reset the game state variables before resetting the game board. This involved updating the checkForWinner() method I created. I also decided to filter out only the buttons before trying to reset them. This proved to allow the “New Game” method to work.
    
•	Displaying the name of the winner rather than ‘Player One’ or ‘Player Two’. 
    
    o	This required adding Microsoft.VisualBasic as a reference so I could enable a new form to pop up before the game started that allows ‘Player One’ and ‘Player Two’ to input their desired name. I have included a screenshot of ‘John wins!’
