Enhancement One is the creation of a Tic Tac Toe app. This app was created in Visual Studio 2022 using C# language. I was inspired by the Calculator app we worked on in class CS-310. I was able add a menu strip for file and help options. I then added 9 buttons (75x75), aligned them, added a new font, and renamed them by rows â€“ Row 1 was A1-A3, Row 2 was B1-B3, and Row 3 was C1-C3. This allowed me to easily identify button locations. I applied a method and command:
a .Show() method for the menu
Application.Exit() command to enable the ability to close the game. 
I set 2 Boolean variables X and O. 
Added an integer variable that was set at 0 and increases each time a move is made (same event handler for each button).
Created a button click method for a click event for all 9 buttons.
Created if/else statements .
Created try/catch block for declaring a winner or tie.

This is improved software in comparison to my Calculator app, a different language than the Calculator app(C++), and expanded complexity in comparison.
