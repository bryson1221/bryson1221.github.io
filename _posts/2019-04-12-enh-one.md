## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

Category One: Software Engineering/Design - Tic-tac-toe application I created while in class CS-319. 

This project is written in C# using Visual Studio 2022 as my IDE. 

Currently, the app looks decent, but I would like to tweak the appearance and possibly resize the application. 

Current issues that need to be fixed are - restarting the game after someone wins or results in a tie. 

When you select File -> new game, the application does not start a new game. Instead, you must exit the application and re-open it. 

I have an option in the app to allow Player One and Player Two to enter their names, but I am experiencing issues with the Game settings I created. 

I would like Player One or Player Two to be able to choose ‘x’ or ‘o’ and which player goes first. 

## Update

TBA
