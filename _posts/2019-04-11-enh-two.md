## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure

Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures - Quiz Game

I will expand the complexity of a quiz game I created when I first began classes at SNHU. 

I would like to add levels of difficulty, some type of scoring system, sound effects, graphics, a timer, a leaderboard, and categories to select from. 

Adding difficulty levels such as easy, medium, and hard allow the user to choose the level they want to play. 

A scoring system will incentive the user to earn points for correct answers and lose points for wrong answers. 

Sound effects and graphics will make it more interactive and engaging. A timer will give the user a certain amount of time to answer each question. 

A leaderboard will store the user’s scores and rank them (maybe a top 10).  

Categories will give the user options and allow them to choose which category they will be quizzed on. 

## Update

I added a timer to each question, that shows how long it took to the user to answer each prompted question. 

- Once the question is answered a dialogue displays whether the user was ‘correct or incorrect’ and shows how long it took to answer the question. 

Each question was previously isolated in an ‘if else’ statement. 

- To improve on this, I refactored my code to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable. 

Once the quiz is completed, a final score is displayed to show how many questions were answered correctly. 
- A new question is then prompted, asking if the user wants to play again. If the user selects ‘yes’ the game will loop through again. If the user selects ‘no’ the game will close.
