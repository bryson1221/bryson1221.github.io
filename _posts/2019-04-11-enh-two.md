## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure

Artifact Two: Algorithms and Data Structures - Quiz Game

I will expand the complexity of a quiz game I created when I first began classes at SNHU. 

I would like to add levels of difficulty, some type of scoring system, sound effects, graphics, a timer, a leaderboard, and categories to select from. 

Adding difficulty levels such as easy, medium, and hard allow the user to choose the level they want to play. 

A scoring system will incentive the user to earn points for correct answers and lose points for wrong answers. 

Sound effects and graphics will make it more interactive and engaging. A timer will give the user a certain amount of time to answer each question. 

A leaderboard will store the userâ€™s scores and rank them (maybe a top 10).  

Categories will give the user options and allow them to choose which category they will be quizzed on. 

## Update

TBA
